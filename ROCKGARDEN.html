              glass. Nek Chand, a former road inspector, began the garden

              creations without the knowledge or approval of authorities.

              Nek Chand's work was driven by a passion for art, nature, and a
              deep connection with his cultural roots. He began the project in
              secret, working on it for nearly 18 years before it was discovered
              by authorities in 1972. Despite the initial resistance, the garden
              gained widespread recognition and was eventually incorporated into
              Chandigarh's official landscape.

            <h3>1. <b>Best Time to Visit</b></h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
              - <b>Early Morning or Late Afternoon:</b> To avoid crowds and
              enjoy a more peaceful experience, it's best to visit early in the
              morning or later in the afternoon. The temperatures are also more
              comfortable at these times, especially in the summer.<br />
              <br />
              - <b>Weather Considerations:</b> The garden is open year-round,
              but if you're looking for the best weather, plan to visit during
              the cooler months (October to March). The summer months (April to
              June) can be quite hot, making early morning visits a good option.
