            <p class="fade-in">
              -<b>Sam Sand Dunes:</b> Located about 40 km from Jaisalmer, Sam is
              one of the most popular spots for camel safaris. The vast,

              - <b>Sunset and Sunrise Views:</b> Watching the sun set or rise
              over the desert dunes is a magical experience. The soft, golden
              hues of the sand and the vastness of the desert create an almost
              surreal atmosphere.

            <p class="fade-in">
              - Camels are gentle giants, and riding one is an experience in
              itself. Camel rides are slow and steady, allowing you to enjoy the
              surroundings at a leisurely pace. The camels are typically led by
              experienced camel drivers (also known as "camel men"), who guide
              you through the desert.<br /><br />
              - For longer safaris, you'll also sleep under the stars in the
              desert, where you can enjoy a night around a campfire, listening
              to folk music, and perhaps even observing desert wildlife like
              wild foxes, jackals, and birds.
