            <h3>1. <b>Best Time to Visit</b></h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
              - <b>Monsoon (July to September):</b> While the landscape is lush
              and green during the monsoon, this season brings heavy rainfall.
              Be cautious, as trails can get slippery and trekking can become
              dangerous. If you're visiting during this time, pack appropriate
              waterproof gear and avoid trekking in heavy rain. <br />
              <br />

              trekking and outdoor activities. The landscape is beautifully
              vibrant after the monsoon. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Winter (December to February):</b> Winters in Dharamkot can
              be quite cold, with temperatures dropping below freezing,
              especially at night. If you're a fan of snow and enjoy winter
              trekking, this is a good time to visit, but be prepared with warm
              clothes, layered clothing, and appropriate footwear.

              to bring a <b>raincoat</b>, <b>umbrella</b>, or
              <b>waterproof gear</b>. The trails can get slippery, and a good
