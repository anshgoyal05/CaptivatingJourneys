            <h3>3. <b>Trekking Tips</b></h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
              - <b>Wear Comfortable Footwear:</b> The path to the waterfall can
              be rocky and uneven, so make sure to wear
              <b>comfortable trekking shoes</b> or sandals with a good grip.
              <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Start Early:</b> It's a good idea to start your trek early in
              the day to avoid the midday heat, especially in summer, and to
              have plenty of time to explore the waterfall and surrounding
              areas. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Stay on the Trail:</b> While the path is marked, some
              sections may be a bit unclear. Stick to the main trail and avoid
              venturing off the beaten path. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Take Your Time:</b> The trek isn't too strenuous, so enjoy
              the natural surroundings, take breaks, and appreciate the views
              along the way.

            <h3>4. <b>What to Carry</b></h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
              - <b>Water:</b> Carry enough water with you, especially in the
              summer months, as it can get hot during the hike to the waterfall.
              Though there are small shops near the trail, it's best to carry
              your own water supply. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Snacks:</b> Bring some <b>energy bars</b>, <b>nuts</b>, or
              other quick snacks to keep your energy levels up during the trek.
              <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Camera/Phone:</b> The waterfall is very photogenic, so don't
              forget to carry your <b>camera</b> or <b>smartphone</b> to capture
              the beauty of the waterfall and surrounding landscape. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Rain Gear:</b> If you're visiting during the monsoon, make
              sure to pack a <b>raincoat</b> or <b>poncho</b> in case it starts
              to rain. The trail can get slippery, so take extra caution. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Sunscreen & Sunglasses:</b> Protect yourself from the sun,
              even if you are visiting during the cooler months, as it can still
              be quite strong at higher altitudes.

            <h3>5. <b>Safety Tips</b>s</h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
              - <b>Water Flow:</b> The waterfall's water flow can be strong,
              particularly during the monsoon. Avoid getting too close to the
              water's edge or attempting to wade through the stream. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Watch Your Step:</b> The rocks around the waterfall can be
              slippery, especially after rain, so always watch your step when
              walking near the water. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Avoid Overcrowding:</b> The area around the waterfall can get
              crowded during peak tourist seasons, so try to visit during
              off-peak hours (early morning or late afternoon) to avoid large
              crowds and enjoy the natural beauty in peace. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Local Wildlife:</b> While the area is generally safe, you may
              encounter some <b>monkeys</b> around the waterfall or on the
              trail. Keep your food and valuables securely stored, and avoid
              feeding the animals.
