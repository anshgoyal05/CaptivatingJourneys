        <div class="row align-items-center my-4">
          <div class="col-md-8">
            <h3>1. <b>Best Time to Visit</b></h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
              - <b>Summer (March to June):</b> The most popular time for
              trekking to Triund. The weather is pleasant, with daytime
              temperatures ranging between 15°C to 20°C, and cooler nights.
              <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Autumn (September to November):</b> This is another ideal
              time to visit as the weather is crisp and clear, offering great
              trekking conditions and clear views of the mountains. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Winter (December to February):</b> The area can be covered
              with <b>snow</b>, making it perfect for snow trekking. However,
              temperatures drop below freezing, so only experienced trekkers
              should consider this, and appropriate winter gear is essential.
              <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Monsoon (July to September):</b> Avoid trekking during the
              monsoon season as the path can become slippery, and there is a
              higher risk of landslides and heavy rainfall.

            <h3>2. <b>Trekking Basics</b></h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
              - <b>Distance & Duration:</b> The trek from <b>McLeod Ganj</b> (or
              Gallu Devi Temple) to Triund is around <b>9 km</b> (5.5 miles). It
              usually takes <b>4-6 hours</b> to ascend, depending on your pace,
              and <b>3-4 hours</b> to descend. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Trekking Difficulty:</b> It's an
              <b>easy to moderate trek</b>, but the last part can be a bit
              steep. The trail is generally well-marked and maintained. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Start Early:</b> Begin the trek early in the morning (around
              <b>7:00 AM</b> or <b>8:00 AM</b>) to avoid the heat (in summer)
              and give yourself ample time to reach Triund before dark. Starting
              early also gives you a better chance to catch the sunrise or
              sunset from the top. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Take Breaks:</b> The trek can be physically demanding, so
              take breaks whenever needed. Enjoy the stunning surroundings and
              stay hydrated. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Stay on the Path:</b> The trek is well-marked, but some
              sections can be tricky. Stay on the trail, and avoid shortcuts or
              off-path routes to prevent getting lost.

              - <b>Trekking:</b> The main activity at Triund is, of course,
              trekking. The trail offers a combination of steep climbs, rocky

              <b>snow-capped Dhauladhar Range</b>, <b>cloud formations</b>, and
              <b>Kangra Valley</b> are especially captivating. <br />

              - <b>Camping and Stargazing:</b> If you stay overnight at Triund,
              the lack of light pollution offers an amazing opportunity for
              <b>stargazing</b> at night. The sky is filled with stars, making
              it a surreal experience. <br />
              <br />

            <h3>4. <b>Altitude and Health Tips</b></h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
              - <b>Altitude:</b> Triund is located at an altitude of around
              <b>2,827 meters (9,275 feet)</b>. While it is not a very
              high-altitude trek, some trekkers may still experience symptoms of
              <b>altitude sickness</b> like shortness of breath or dizziness. To
              avoid this, take it slow and stay hydrated. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Rest & Hydrate:</b> Take frequent breaks, especially in the
              initial stages of the trek, to acclimatize to the altitude and
              prevent fatigue. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Don't Overexert:</b> If you feel tired or unwell, stop, rest,
              and hydrate. Don't rush, and always trek at your own pace.

            <h3>5. <b>Safety and Security</b>s</h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
              - <b>Trek with a Group:</b> If you are new to trekking, consider
              going with a guide or a group, especially if you are not familiar
              with the area. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Mobile Network:</b> <b>Mobile connectivity</b> may be spotty
              in certain parts of the trek, particularly higher up. However, you
              will generally have network coverage at <b>McLeod Ganj</b> and the
              base of the trek. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Emergency Services:</b> In case of any emergency, you can
              contact the local authorities or the police at <b>McLeod Ganj</b>.
              Make sure to share your travel itinerary with someone before
              starting the trek. <br />
              <br />
              - <b>Wildlife Awareness:</b> While it's rare, there are wild
              animals in the area, including <b>monkeys</b> and <b>leopards</b>.
              Avoid leaving food unattended and stay cautious, especially during
              the evening.
